# Level 3 Clues

A RuneLite plugin that indicates whether a clue scroll is considered "good" or "bad" for Level 3 skillers. The plugin overlays information to help players identify clues that may require combat, entering Morytania, or are otherwise inaccessible to Level 3 accounts.

## Features

- Shows an indicator for each clue scroll: **Good Clue** or **Bad Clue** for Level 3 skillers
- Highlights clue tiles with customizable colors
- Automatically detects clue types and requirements
- Considers quest-locked and dangerous areas (such as Morytania)
